Phase 2
========================Tasbir Rahman=====================
I converted all the print statements so that they use the logger.
I added logging to all the events when read. I refactored a lot of
the code and documentation so that it is more descriptive. I also removed some 
instances of hardcoding in WarehouseFloor and WorkerManager. I also did some of 
the walkthrough and created the TestSuite class along with updating
help.txt to show how to run it. 

========================Peijun Ma=========================
I broke up Warehouse class into smaller classes.I added FileSystem, PickingRequestManager, 
WorkerManager, Location, MasterSystem classes. 
I wrote all of the unit tests for phase 2 except for WorkerTest. I also
implemented the rescan method in Worker. I did some of the walkthrough.

==================Venkata Chaitanya Peesapati===================
I created and implemented some unittests. I redid half the UML with Andrew doing the other 
half. I helped find and tweak smaller bugs as I came across them. We all contributed to making
design decisions.

========================Andrew Olechtchouk=========================
I took part in redesigning and remaking the UML diagram along with 
Chaitanya. I also made changes to documentation in some parts of the
program by fixing things such as grammar and obsolete parts of
the docstrings.
