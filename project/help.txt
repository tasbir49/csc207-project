This tutorial assumes you have already cloned the repo and changed directory to repo/project. 

The following commands should be entered into the terminal to compile and execute the program:
-------------------
cd src
javac util/Main.java
-------------------

We have provided 3 different event files, to run simulation on one of them,
use one of the following commands:
-------------------
java util/Main ../events.txt
java util/Main ../rescan_demo.txt
java util/Main ../fail_demo.txt
-------------------

After this, the program should run and automatically select files for input.
It will output to orders.csv, final.csv and log.txt in project/.

To compile and run tests, stay in the same directory and do these commands
-------------------
javac -cp lib/junit-4.12.jar:. tests/TestSuite.java
java -cp lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.12.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore tests.TestSuite
