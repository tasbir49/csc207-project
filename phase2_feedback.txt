PHASE 2 MARKING

group_0376 Phase 2 Grade: B

Phase 2 marks are based on the group presentations (including code and
design quality and project completeness) and your group's unit test
coverage.  Because we did not give you Checkstyle feedback from Phase
1 on time, we have excluded that from the marking.

There is an individual component as well.  Your individual mark was
affected by how well you were able to answer the individual questions.

Before asking for more information about the marking, please re-read
the entire phase 2 handout that is in your group repository, and in
particular everything from "What to do for Phase 2" to the end of the
handout.

Here is the feedback from the TAs:

Your code uses many design patterns, contains good documentation, and adequate
testing. The status of workers should be either stored or tracked in order to
make the system more robust. You have a number of circular dependencies. For
example, the MasterSystem contains everything you need for a warehouse, but
the worker classes (inside the MaterSystem) contain MasterSystem information.
The MVC pattern helps eliminate this sort of problem by classifying every
method or variable as Model (information that needs to be stored), Controller
(functionality that interacts with the system boundaries and the model - for
example, sending and receiving requests), and the View (classes that display
information such as printing a log message to the screen or a file).


We opened each project in Eclipse and ran EclEmma.  Here is how we applied the
code coverage deduction:
